# Lesson 1 - How do computers communicate? 

##Introduction
[[intro spiel to finish]]
How do computers communicate? In this lesson will build a simple network and use it to communicate using a network chat program.

Computer networks are everywhere, from the web to mobile phones, social networking, cash machines to video streaming; traffic lights to online games.

Networks can be hugely complicated but they can also be as simple as two computers or devices connected together. In this lesson students will learn how to network two Raspberry Pis and then write a small program in Python that allows them to send messages to each other.

If students are not confident with setting up the Raspberry Pi and editing and running Python programs you might want to try a scheme of work such as the [Turing Test](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/turing-test-lessons)first.

## Learning Objectives

- Know that a computer network consists of two or more computers (or devices) connected together
- Know that computers have an unique IP address that allows other computers to find them and send data to them

## Learning Outcomes

###All students are able to:

- explain that a computer network is two or more computers joined together
- use a simple program to send messages between two computers

###Most students are able to:

- explain that every computer on a network needs a unique addreess called an IP address
- make simple changes to their program such as changing screen prompts and adding welcome messages

###Some students are able to:

- make more complex changes to their program such as sending responses to key words


## Lesson Summary

- An introduction to simple computer networks
- Networking the Raspberry Pis
- Writing the chat program

##Homework
In the previous lesson ask the students to watch [this video on basic networking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNJZ-v263zc). Then, using the web, research and write down what they understand by the following terms: computer network; IP address; server; client; LAN. They will need to understand these terms for this lesson (without their homework in front of them, so cut and paste won't help!)

## Starter
Explain that two computers chatting are the basis of every single transaction on the internet and phone networks. Blah... [some unpugged stuff here]


## Main Development

1.

4.  

5. Students set up network and send messages using the [Student Instructions](student-instructions-1.md).

6. If you will be using the SD cards again on a network, student will need to revert their changes to the `interfaces` file. Ask them to do this as per the 'Cleanup' section of the student instructions.

## Plenary

Write the following list of words on the board:

- Server
- Client
- Computer network
- IP address
- Static IP address
- LAN

Select a student randomly from the class. They must select one of the words from the board, stand up and point to someone else in the class who must then give the meaning of the word. That person then chooses the next person to give a word to.
