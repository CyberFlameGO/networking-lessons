# Lesson 1 - How do computers communicate? 

##Introduction

How do computers communicate? In this lesson will build a simple network to use it to communicate using a a network chat program.

Computer networks are everywhere, from the web to mobile phones, social networking, cash machines to video streaming; traffic lights to online games.

Networks can be hugely complicated but they can also be as simple as two computers or devices connected together. In this lesson students will learn how to network two Raspberry Pis and then write a small program in Python that allows them to send messages to each other.

If students are not confident with setting up the Raspberry Pi and editing and running Python programs you might want to try a scheme of work such as the [Turing Test](link).

## Learning Objectives

- Know that a computer network consists of two or more computers (or devices) connected together
- Know that computers have an unique IP address that allows other computers to find them and send data to them

## Learning Outcomes

###All students are able to:

- Know that the a computer network is two or more computers joined together 
- Write a simple program. 

###Most students are able to:

###Some students are able to:

- Edit their program to change behaviour such as prompts and output.


## Lesson Summary

- An introduction to computer networks
- Networking the Raspberry Pis
- Writing the chat program

##Homework
In the previous lesson ask the students to watch [this video on basic networking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNJZ-v263zc). Then, using the web, research and write down what they understand by the following terms: computer network; IP address; server; client; LAN. They will need to understand these terms for this lesson (without their homework in front of them, so cut and paste won't help!)

## Starter
Explain that two computers chatting are the basis of every single transaction on the internet and phone networks.

5. Show students how to draw a shape by typing a sequence of instructions, line by line. See the [Student Instructions](student-instructions-1.md) for the steps required to complete this task.

6. Ask students to shut down their Raspberry Pis by clicking on the **Shut Down** icon on the desktop. 

## Plenary

Write the following list of words on the board:

- Server
- Client
- Computer network
- IP address
- Static IP address
- LAN

Select a student randomly from the class. They must select one of the words from the board, stand up and point to someone else in the class who must then give the meaning of the word. That person then chooses the next person to give a word to.
