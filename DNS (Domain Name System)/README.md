Domain Name System (DNS)
==================

This learning resource describes a practical exercise where the Raspberry Pi is used to demonstrate the Domain Name System (DNS) on an isolated network.

## Introduction

It is recommended that the previous ![DHCP lesson](../DHCP%20(Dynamic%20Host%20Configuration%20Protocol)/) has been completed by all students before attempting this. It is important to complete them in this order because understanding DNS requires the understanding of its relationship to DHCP. Please note that DNS is a fairly complex subject and this resource is only an introduction to the concepts. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide.

You may have noticed that it can be a bit tricky to remember IP addresses. They are comprised of four 8-bit numbers separated by dots. For example: `192.168.0.146`. Human beings often find it difficult to remember a sequence of numbers like this and find it a lot easier to remember a word or a name instead.

When we want to access resources on our network such as a web server we currently have to remember the IP address. How can we make it easier for people to connect to network servers without having to remember the IP address numbers?

## Learning Objectives


- Understand what the Domain Name System (DNS) is
- Know the role it plays in the overall structure of a computer network and the Internet

## Learning Outcomes

### All students are able to:

- Understand the need for DNS in a computer network and the Internet
- Use DNS server to connect to a network resource/server

### Most students are able to:

- Understand the internal logic of a DNS server

## Lesson Summary


- A discussion of the logical process followed by a DNS service
- Setting up one Raspberry Pi to be a DNS server
- Use other Raspberry Pi's to perform DNS queries
- Testing the network

## Resources

For the majority of the lesson, it is suggested that work is carried out by students in pairs. The Ethernet hub or switch should remain completely isolated without any Ethernet cables connecting it into the main school network.

- The DHCP server Raspberry Pi from the previous lesson;
- A Raspberry Pi per pair of students;
- An Ethernet cable per pair;
- NOOBS SD card with Raspbian installed per pair;
- A keyboard and mouse connected to the RPi per pair;
- A monitor connected to the RPi per pair;
- An Ethernet hub or switch with enough ports to connect all the RPis;
- A set of cards with a selection of numbers on them (starter activity)
- A piece of paper and a pen or pencil (starter activity)
